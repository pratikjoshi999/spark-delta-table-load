4.	Test that the job that ingests data into the Delta table fails gracefully and does not modify the table if the Delta table is not accessible or not in the expected location.
5.	Test that the job that ingests data into the Delta table correctly handles the case where the Delta table already contains some data and only appends the new data.
6.	Test that the job that ingests data into the Delta table correctly handles the case where the Delta table is empty and the new data is the first data to be added.
7.	Test that the job that ingests data into the Delta table correctly handles the case where the Delta table is already up to date with the source data and does not add any new rows.
